I'm Shirling, a PM living in New York City.

At Microsoft, I launched security products and led the roadmap and strategy for a partnership with Amazon. Previously, I also designed and developed an infrastructure risk assessment tool for the U.S. DHS.

I'm an [ENFJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENFJ). I love building communities and meeting new people. I started [a podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/06VOdssQHF2Y0iCV7Hxmu8) and run club at Microsoft. In my free time, I like [taking pictures](https://www.instagram.com/shirlingpics), [long-distance running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/118068123), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/shirlingxu), [writing](https://www.substack.com/@shirling), and [baking](https://www.instagram.com/shirlingbakes). A fun fact about me is that I'm running the 2026 NYC Marathon.
