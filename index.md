I'm Shirling, a product manager living in New York City.

At Microsoft, I led our strategy and roadmap for our authentication protocol blocking and logging partnership with Amazon. I also launched security products on Azure and GCP Marketplace for IT admins. Previously, I designed and developed an infrastructure risk assessment tool for the US DHS, which I presented at their national summit.

I'm an [ENFJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENFJ). I love building communities and meeting new people. In my free time, I like [taking pictures](https://www.instagram.com/shirlingpics), [long-distance running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/118068123), [baking](https://www.instagram.com/shirlingbakes), [writing](https://www.substack.com/@shirling), and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/shirlingxu). A fun fact about me is that I recently ran the perimeter of Manhattan. I started [a podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/06VOdssQHF2Y0iCV7Hxmu8) and run club at Microsoft, and I'm running the New York City Marathon in 2026.
